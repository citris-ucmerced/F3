Future innovators and entrepreneurs at UC Merced attend seminar on patent creation,Futureinnovators.jpg,,"Over 20 students gathered to hear Vineet Kohli, Legal Counsel and Director of Intellectual Property at BlueNalu, provide valuable insight on patentability considerations. The seminar, "Is your research the big catch?," was organized by the university's Office of Technology, Innovation, and Industry Relations, and aimed to equip current and future innovators with industry expertise on patent creation.Kohli emphasized the significance of novelty as a crucial factor when drafting a patent, highlighting that a lack of novelty can result in the rejection of a patent application. He also introduced key phrases commonly used in the patent process, such as "unexpected results," "teaching away," and "failure of others." Notably, Kohli mentioned that anyone who can become a patent agent does not require you to graduate from a law school and encouraged students to look into this career path.","YYYY-MM-DD"

"UC Merced student engagement: Innovation Harvest grows AI skills",Future_Innovators_img.png,https://forms.office.com/r/TQAH73dPyv,"Agricultural innovation was the focus of an evening workshop on AI on Oct. 26 at the University of California, Merced Arts and Computational Sciences building. Hosted by VISTA F3 Innovate and Tesserakt Ventures the ‚ÄúInnovation Harvest‚Äù workshop hosted undergraduate-students and dove into the intriguing world of artificial intelligence in agriculture and explored applications of ChatGPT, an OpenAI platform. This workshop provided a hands-on learning experience for UC Merced students to gain knowledge about agriculture and tech careers.  The next workshop is scheduled for November 16, at 5:30-7:30 p.m. in the Dr. Vikram & Priya Lakireddy Ballroom at UC Merced, where the focus will shift to database applications and rapid prototyping. Sign up here: https://forms.office.com/r/TQAH73dPyv Keynote speaker, Daniel Sabzehzar, from Tesserakt Ventures, is a UC Merced alum and local venture capital fund manager. He shared insights into how artificial intelligence can revolutionize farming practices and increase agricultural productivity, making it clear that the agricultural industry is ripe for technological disruption, with an emphasis on inclusive innovation. As students practiced agile development they played with the versatile tool of ChatGPT, known for its proficiency in natural language processing and generation. Sabzehzar guided the participants through the process of using ChatGPT to create code, unlocking new opportunities for innovation and problem-solving. They were tasked with creating codes and developing AI solutions that could benefit the agricultural industry. As the room buzzed with creative energy, students collaborated, to craft innovative solutions and took turns presenting those ideas to the other attendees. Michael Tapia, fourth year computer science major at UC Merced said, ‚ÄúI never realized how easy it is to get a working product using AI.‚Äù He noted how interesting it was to see the different projects students were able to create in such a short amount of time.  At the start of the workshop, students were asked to describe the biggest problems with our food system in three words; waste, disease, unsustainable, global warming and low quality were popular answers among attendees. This helped start the conversation of agriculture and the need for technological advances in the industry, such as the farm ng Amiga Robot. Sabzehzar introduced students to the Amiga robot and encouraged them to participate in the 2024 Farm Robot Challenge to help create new applications for this micro-tractor. The Amiga was created to help growers to easily create farming solutions and reduce manual labor.  If you‚Äôd like to join a FarmBot Challenge team, contact vista@ucmerced.edu Sabzehzar underlined the importance of innovation in his address to the students. He stressed that the world of AI and agriculture was ever-evolving, with endless possibilities waiting to be discovered. He encouraged the students to use their newfound knowledge and skills to dream, create, and apply their ideas, remarking, "You get to invent stuff that doesn't yet exist." Lucia Barboza, third year computer science and engineering major at UC Merced said, ‚ÄúInnovation Harvest introduced me to the world of AgTech. It was inspiring to see participants use ChatGPT to develop web apps that address local farming challenges.‚Äù The Valley Institute for Sustainability, Technology, and Agriculture, known as VISTA, is at the forefront of addressing critical environmental and societal challenges. Among VISTA‚Äôs initiatives is the Farms-Food-Future Innovation Initiative, aimed at finding innovative solutions to pressing issues. The Fresno-Merced Future of Food Innovation (F3) Coalition secured a record breaking $65.1 million federal grant, the largest ever in California‚Äôs Central Valley. This funding is set to propel research and climate-smart food system solutions. The hub‚Äôs mission is to unite farms with industry and communities, fostering productivity, job creation, and regional sustainability for the benefit of local communities."
