Development of a smart water pre-treatment system for controlled environment agriculture using micro-plasma and AI machines,"Sankha Banerjee, Venkattraman Ayyaswamy, Gerardo Diaz","This project aims to develop a sustainable system for recovering irrigation water and valuable nutrients from nontraditional water sources like brackish and agricultural drainage waters using an innovative micro-plasma-assisted water treatment process coupled with integrated nanofiltration systems. The project also aims to assess the feasibility of other downstream water treatment and desalination processes for water sources with elevated levels of total dissolved solids. The ultimate goal is to develop a proof-of-concept smart water pre-treatment system using connected and real-time water quality monitoring, nanofiltration membranes, micro-plasma, and AI machines for controlled environment agriculture applications.",water_treatment.jpg
Robotics implementations in precision viticulture systems,"Luca Brillante, Stefano Carpin",Autonomous ground robots can collect diverse data at scale for a variety of high-value perennial crops. This approach is complementary to remote sensing as robots operating in the vineyard and orchard can perform proximal measurements that cannot be done remotely. ,viticulture.jpg
Non-invasive Hybrid Sensing of Key Chemical Compositions of Grapes,"Ricardo de Castro, Luca Brillante, Reza Ehsani","The project aims to develop a non-invasive hybrid sensing system that combines near-infrared and Raman spectroscopy with machine learning models to monitor key chemical substances in grapes, such as sugar, acidity, and anthocyanins. The system will be experimentally validated at the CSU Fresno vineyard using samples from 70 different varieties of table and wine grapes. This technology could enable ultra-precision agricultural practices and be integrated into future robotic data scouts for large-scale mapping of grape quality in real-time.",grapes.jpg
AI-Based Irrigation Management and Control System for Improved Water Efficiency,"Wan Du, Khaled Bali","The project aims to develop and to test an AI irrigation management system to improve water efficiency in almond orchards at Kearney Agricultural Research and Extension Center. The system will use real-time data such as ET, soil moisture, plant temperature, and stem water potential to estimate actual water demand and apply the appropriate amount of water to prevent plant stress and maximize yield. The system uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and a deep neural network to integrate information. ",irrigation.jpg
California's Water for Farms:  Irrigation Decisions Under Climate Change,"Qin Fan, Safeeq Khan, Jiaochen (Jason) Liang","This study is the first to assess the impact of climate change on irrigation decisions, crop yield, and water demand in California. The study uses an econometric model to estimate irrigation decisions by crop type under different climate and weather conditions. The researchers then project changes in irrigated areas under future climate changes and propose a multi-disciplinary approach to account for dynamic human decisions and water systems. The research aims to guide farmers in adaptive decision-making processes and has important policy implications for local and regional groundwater management plans and collective adaptation strategies.",water_agriculture.jpg
"Accessibility of Smart Agriculture Technologies among Small Farmers in Central San Joaquin Valley, California","Soumyasanta Laha, Ruth Dahlquist-Willard, Serhat Asci, Florence Cassel, Hubert Cecotti, Dave Ghorahoo","This project aims to address the technological needs and challenges of small farmers in the San Joaquin Valley. Workshops will be organized to interact closely with small farmers and assess their technical necessities. An extensive survey will evaluate current smart agriculture technologies for downscaling in terms of affordability and complexity to serve small farmers. The feasibility and economic impact of including advanced technologies like the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Image Processing in smart farming will also be evaluated.",small_farmer.jpg
Air Bipolar Ionization of Indoor Mushroom Farm Environments for Reducing Energy and Water Use,"Deify Law, Venkattraman Ayyaswamy","This project aims to use bipolar ionization (BPI) technology to clean and to treat indoor mushroom farm environments with pollutants like airborne particulate matters, volatile organic compounds, and pathogens. The BPI system will be used in combination with a filter to match the performance of a HEPA filter and reduce energy consumption. The project also aims to reduce water consumption in controlled indoor mushroom growing environments.",mushrooms.jpg
Development of Artificial Intelligence Controlled Fuel Cell based Hybrid Power System in Agricultural applications ,"Woonki Na, Po Ya Abel Chuang","This project proposes the development of an AI-controlled fuel cell-based hybrid power system for agricultural applications, specifically for irrigation systems. The goal is to develop an advanced controller for power electronics in renewable energy systems and effective dynamic energy system models to ensure efficient and reliable energy flow control using AI. The proposed system will be validated using various computer simulation tools and Hardware-In-the-Loop systems.",power.jpg
"Using biochar co-compost to foster a climate smart, circular agriculture economy","Rebecca Ryals, Xuan Zhang, Catherine Keske",This proposal aims to investigate the potential of biochar to minimize air pollution from composting in California. The study will quantify the impact of biochar co-composting on emissions of air pollutants and conduct an economic assessment of biochar co-compost production in the San Joaquin Valley.,soil.jpg
Development of an Interactive Information System to Improve Agricultural Farm Management Efficiency,"Dilruba Yeasmin, Giulia Marino","A proposed interactive information system and database that utilizes Geographic Information System and its database management platform combined with ArcGIS online will cover the experimental farms of Fresno State University campus and Kearney Agricultural Research and Extension Center, helping farm managers, owners, advisors, and researchers make informed and timely management decisions. The system will contain multiple datasets about an agricultural farm, its available resources, operations, and management practices, and will cover a range of crops.",dashboard.jpg
Automated Irrigation Powered by Harvested Energy from Slowly-Flowing Water,"Jian-Qiao Sun , Yuanyuan Xie","The success of the project can contribute a sustainable energy and to help agriculture become more energy efficient by validating technologies to harvest energy from very slow water flows such as tides and river deltas at low-cost for various agricultural applications. The project will develop a mathematical model to understand the energy harvesting concept and efficiency of hydro-chute and develop a networked hydro-chute system that is self-powered by the harvested energy. The system will be automated by a self-learning AI algorithm for optimal irrigation and electricity generation, and a prototype will be tested to validate the concept and refine the design.",water_energy.jpg
