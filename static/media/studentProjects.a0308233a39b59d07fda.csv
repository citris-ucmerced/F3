Life Cycle Assessment and Nitrogen Accounting of Compost Application,"Zachary Malone, Rebecca Ryals",Environmental Sciences,"Organic matter amendment plays a crucial role in soil health and waste diversion. Under California
Senate Bill 1383, significant quantities of organic resources are allocated to this purpose to reduce
landfill waste. However, comprehensive studies assessing the impacts of compost on soil health,
nitrogen cycle, hydrology, and plants are limited. This project aims to conduct a holistic assessment by
measuring changes in soil carbon, nitrogen fluxes, hydrologic impacts, and plant parameters after
compost application. The study will provide insights into the climate benefits of compost and its
relevance to traditional agriculture, supporting the development of a circular nutrient economy and
sustainable waste management.",Production-System Improvements,compost.jpg
Enhancing Mechanical Harvesting Machines for Nut Trees Using a Data-Driven Model,"Mohsen Farajijalal, Reza Ehsani",Mechanical Engineering,"The project aims to develop intelligent harvesting machines for nut trees that automatically adjust
shaking parameters for each tree. This optimizes fruit removal, reduces tree damage, and decreases
energy input and fuel consumption. The two-year project focuses on almond trees in the first year and
pistachio trees in the second year. Multiple sensors will collect tree-specific data, including trunk
diameter, while an AI model predicts optimal shaking parameters based on tree parameters. An acoustic-
based fruit drop rate sensor will help operators determine when to stop shaking. The project outcome
will be a model integrated into existing harvesting machines' hydraulic control systems for optimal
shaking frequency.",Production-System Improvements,nut_trees.jpg
Climate Resilience and Regenerative Agriculture,"Jennifer Alvarez, Teamrat Ghezzehei",Life and Environmental Sciences,"This proposed dissertation aims to investigate the reasons behind the limited benefits observed in soil
carbon sequestration and water conservation from regenerative agricultural practices. Focusing on
California's Central Valley, the research will analyze the impact of these practices on soil structure,
hydraulic functions, and carbon mineralization. It will also explore water management strategies to
optimize agricultural productivity, carbon sequestration, and water conservation. Additionally, the study
will examine how long-term implementation of regenerative practices has affected soil health metrics
related to water conservation and carbon stabilization. The research aims to develop effective
management practices for achieving sustainable agriculture goals.",Water Efficiency and Regenerative Agriculture,agriculture2.jpg
Regenerative Agriculture Innovation: Transition Towards Water Use Efficiency,"Nicolas Goncalves, Tea Lempiala",Management of Complex Systems,"California's Central Valley produces 25% of the nation's food using less than 1% of U.S. farmland.
Regenerative agriculture is a farming innovation that focuses on soil carbon, health and water efficiency,
but there is limited understanding of the process to transition to regenerative agriculture. We will
conduct semi-structured interviews to understand and define regenerative agriculture. Secondly we will
quantify the net water use from conventional and regenerative rpduction across several staple crops in
the San Joaquin Valley.",Water Efficiency and Regenerative Agriculture,irrigation3.jpg
"OptiMoistube: Optimizing California's Irrigation Systems for Climate Resilience through an
Innovative Moistube Technology","Shahriyar Hekmat, Yanbao Ma",Mechanical Engineering,"Droughts, climate change, increased heat and groundwater regulation mean that California agriculture
must conserve more water while still producing food to feed the world. To compensate for the deficiency
of irrigation water, this project demonstrates the increased water use efficiency of moistube irrigation
compared with traditional drip irrigation. We will conduct indoor soil box experiments and test in
multiple flow and enviornmental conditions. We will develop a numerical tool that can be applied in the
design and operation of moistube for rapid adoption of the technology. Validating technologies is a good
way for UC Merced to contribute to agtech innovation and adoption.",Water Efficiency and Regenerative Agriculture,california_aqueduct.jpg
"ESFSim: Building an Experimental Smart Farm Simulation System for Interdisciplinary
Research in Sustainable Agriculture","Adam Weingram, Xiaoyi Lu",Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"UC Merced Experimental Smart Farm (ESF) facilitates interdisciplinary research in automation,
sustainability, and data processing within specialty crop farming. To overcome the limitations of physical
farm research, we will create a digital simulation and analysis platform called the Experimental Smart
Farm Simulation (ESFSim). This platform would leverage real-world data from the ESF to enable efficient
experiments and explore ideas not feasible on a real farm. The ESFSim aims to be a small-scale,
expandable, campus-shared, and cloud-based system, fostering collaboration and resource
optimization. The platform's goal is to accelerate agricultural research and contribute to industry
advancements.",Data Science,smart_farm.jpg
"Reliable and Energy-Efficient LoRa Networks for Smart Irrigation and Groundwater Recharging
in Orchards","Kang Yang, Wan Du",Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Effective water resource management through smart irrigation and groundwater recharge are tools for
addressing climate change and resource efficiencies in agriculture. Data applications
necessitate deploying numerous sensor nodes in the field to collect sensory data for making
informed water usage decisions, optimizing water use in smart irrigation. A dependable
and energy-efficient data transmission system is vital for supporting these applications.
We plan to develop an algorithm to determine the optimal number and location of gateways in orchards,
ensuring reliable data collection with minimal gateway construction costs. Additionally, we will create a
network model to establish the relationship between configurable parameters and the network's
reliability and energy efficiency. Using this relationship, we will propose an algorithm to optimize sensor
node parameters, enabling smart irrigation and groundwater recharging in orchards.",Data Science,irrigation2.jpg
"Automation, Cyberphysical Systems , Robotics , and Mechatronics","Lorenzo Booth, Stefano Carpin",Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,"Automated methods have the potential to enable sustainable agroecosystem development by reducing
labor requirements. We propose planning algorithms for robotic sampling to enable resource accounting
and precision agriculture operations. Our system utilizes geostatistical principles to model dynamic
processes in agriculture. The algorithms prioritize sampling in areas with higher uncertainty, leveraging
previous information and field knowledge. We plan field trials and system improvements, allowing the

Bas ed Mobile Sensing Solution","Di An, YangQuan Chen",Mechanical Engineering,"iScan is a low-cost, fast-reaction, quantification method of sensing soil carbon in practice based on
explainable AI and IoT (XAIoT) technologies. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine if soil carbon
management is being used in a site-specific agricultural application to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, saving extracosts on agriculture (labors, fertilizer usage) so that it can improve the economic
development in low-income and disadvantaged farming and adjacent communities, and to use it as a
sustainable best practice for California agriculture that also meets the requirements of the California
Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32) and law SB1383.",Data Science,soil2.jpg
