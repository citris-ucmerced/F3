Development of a smart water pre-treatment system for controlled environment agriculture using micro-plasma and AI machines,"Sankha Banerjee, Venkattraman Ayyaswamy, Gerardo Diaz","Inland agricultural regions are increasingly experiencing water scarcity and higher salinity in water sources. Precision separations are required to extract phytotoxic constituents and nutrients from brackish water sources enablinguse as irrigation water and reducing agriculture�s dependence on fertilizers. The long-term goals of the project are to sustainably recover irrigation water and valuable nutrients from nontraditional water sources, including brackishand agricultural drainage waters, and provide stakeholders with knowledge of best practices for managing salinity and nutrients in farming operations, especially in the area of controlled environment agriculture (CEA). An innovativemicro-plasma-assisted water treatment process coupled with integrated nanofiltration systems for the removal of micro and nanoparticle-based organic and inorganic contaminants to improve the efficiency of the downstream ionexchange processes allowing treatment of waters with elevated levels of total dissolved solids (TDS). Additionally, the feasibility of other downstream water treatment and desalination processes will be assessed based on systemparameters such as ionic species removal/recombination and TDS levels of the water sources. The project aims to develop a proof-of-concept smart water pre-treatment system using a connected and real-time water quality monitoringsystem using nanofiltration membranes, micro-plasma, and AI machines for CEA applications.",grapes.jpg
Partnership to advance robotics implementations in viticulture systems,"Luca Brillante, Stefano Carpin","Autonomous ground robots (aka UGV) offer the possibility to collect heterogeneous data at scalefor a variety of high-value perennial crops (including, but not limited to grapes, nuts, stone fruit).This approach is complementary to remote sensing as robots operating in the vineyard/orchard canperform proximal measurements that cannot be done remotely. Notwithstanding these advantages,a systematic integration of AI and robotic technologies to the field of viticulture is still missing.
The short term objective of this project is to create the basis for a synergy between the roboticslab at UC Merced led by Prof. Stefano Carpin (Co-PI) and the precision viticulture lab at CSU Fresnoled by Prof. Luca Brillante (PI). More precisely, the objective is to equip CSU Fresno with state of theart robotic equipment mirroring the system developed through the years by the robotics group atUC Merced and to then use this system to collect data relevant for viticulture research beingcurrently performed at CSU Fresno.The longer term objective of this seed project is to lay the foundation to a long lastingcollaboration that will then be leveraged to target federal and state funding opportunities in thearea of precision viticulture, with a specific aim at sustainable practices. This partnership will bringtogether scholars with proven expertise in robotics/AI and viticulture, respective point of force in thetwo participating institutions. Hence the collaboration will lead to a new research consortium thatwill not have the same impact unless the two institutions come together.",viticulture_robot.png
Non-invasive Hybrid Sensing of Key Chemical Compositions of Grapes,"Recardo de Castro, Luca Brillante, Reza Ehsani","This project aims to develop an optical-based sensing system for monitoring quality factors ofgrapes in the field during the growing season. We will focus on monitoring key chemical substances,such as sugar, acidity and anthocyanins, which affect aroma and color of wines and play a key role inthe ripening of grapes. A non-invasive hybrid sensing approach will be developed, which combinestwo types of optical sensing devices (near-infrared and Raman spectroscopy) together with machine-
learning models to improve the estimation of key chemical composition of grapes. Our approach willbe experimentally validated at the vineyard of the CSU Fresno, using samples from 70 differentvarieties of table and wine grapes.The proposed hybrid sensing will provide an important source of information for enabling ultra-precision agricultural practices in vineyards, where each plant receives a precise amount of inputs(water, pesticides, nutrients, etc.) based on the data provided by our system. This sensing systemcan also be integrated in future robotic data scouts to autonomously perform large-scale mapping ofgrape quality in real-time.",water_treatment.jpg
AI-Based Irrigation Management and Control System for Improved Water Efficiency,"Wan Du, Khaled Bali","This project will develop and test an Artificial Intelligence (AI) irrigation management and controlsystem for improving agricultural water use efficiency. We will use almond orchards at KARE todeploy our system, as almond is the number one crop in California as well as in the Fresno-Mercedregion. Current irrigation practices are based on verities of methods related to referenceevapotranspiration (ET) and crop coefficients, soil moisture measurements, or the grower�s
experience. A combination of actual ET, real-time soil moisture, plant temperature, and stem waterpotential (SWP) would greatly improve the estimation of the actual water demand. We will developan AI-based data-driven irrigation management and control system to apply the right amount ofwater to prevent plant stress and maximize yield. It adopts Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) anda deep neural network to integrate all the information into an optimal irrigation control policy. Wehave developed a DRL-controlled irrigation management system and tested it in a small testbed ofsix almond trees at UC Merced [1]. In this project, we will work with our industry partners (Tule andAlmond Board California) to make our system ready to be deployed in almond orchards. We will testour system in the almond field at KARE on approximately one acre of orchard using 12 variable rateirrigation zones that can deliver water for up to 10 trees per zone. Finally, we will work with ourindustry partners to integrate and commercialize our irrigation system through their existing services.",grapes.jpg
California�s Water for Farms:  Irrigation Decisions Under Climate Change,"Qin Fan, Safeeq Khan, Jiaochen (Jason) Liang","California is the largest producer of agricultural products in U.S. and leads the country as the topexporter of a wide variety of vegetables, fruits, and nuts, with sales of $49.1 billion in 2020. Irrigationis essential for California�s agricultural success considering drought condition especially underchanges in climate. During multi-year drought, declines in surface water have increased demand forgroundwater pumping, causing negative consequences of groundwater overdraft. In this study, we
first employ an econometric model to estimate irrigation decisions by crop type under differentclimate and weather conditions. Second, we project changes in irrigated areas under future changesin climate based on the estimated coefficients of climate variables. Next, we propose a multi-disciplinary approach to couple an economic model and a hydrology model particularly for MercedCounty as a pilot study to account for both dynamic human decisions under climate change andphysical water system. This is the first study that assesses the impact of climate change and theresulting changes in irrigated decisions, crop yield and water demand, to our knowledge, whichaccounts for changes in water demand and supply along with the interactions between the humansystem and physical water system under different climate change scenarios. This research will guidethe local farmers through the adaptive decision-making process under uncertainties in futureclimate and weather extremes. In addition, results will have important policy implications regardingregional and local groundwater management plans and collective adaptation strategies for loweringgroundwater irrigation use and improving irrigation efficiency.",viticulture_robot.png

The proposedproject will include both an extensive and intensive field study to understand the technological needs and challenges of small farmers in the SJV. As part of the field study, multiple workshops among the small farmersfarming communities in the region will be organized to closely interact with the farmers to address their technical necessities. An extensive survey on the current technologies of smart agriculture will be initiated toassess their downscaling, in terms of affordability and complexity to serve the needs of these small farmers. The feasibility of inclusion of advanced technologies such as Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, andImage Processing to the smart farming of small farmers will also be evaluated along with the economic impact associated with the adoption of these innovative tools. From a research trial standpoint, assessment of theNUE and WUE management strategies on such term vegetable crops will be conducted as a pilot study to serve as demonstration plots. Ultimately, the development of a �beta version� web form/app for Irrigated Landsnitrogen reporting is envisioned.",water_treatment.jpg
Development of Artificial Intelligence Controlled Fuel Cell based Hybrid Power System in Agricultural applications ,"Deify Law, Venkattraman Ayyaswamy","Controlled-environment agriculture (CEA), which includes vertical farms and greenhouses, hasseveral benefits over traditional field farming including reliable year-round crop production, waterusage minimization, environmental conservation, and space use efficiency [1]. Indoor-cultivatedcrops include but not limited to mushrooms, tomatoes, herbs, microgreens, and leafy greens.However, currently only a very small portion of fresh vegetables are produced indoors [1]. The one
exception is the mushroom industry, which represents a US$1.15 billion industry [2]. Mushroom is afungus, and it is very vulnerable to contamination, particularly in Central Valley for its notorious airquality due to smog, smoke, and airborne pollutants from wildfires, transportation, and largeindustries. The proposed work is to employ bipolar ionization (BPI) technology to clean and treatindoor mushroom farm environments from airborne fine particulate matters (PM), volatile organiccompounds (VOCs), and pathogens (bacteria colony). The principle of BPI is to apply a voltage to thesurface of a tube and cause a non-thermal plasma discharge on the surface of the tube, which thenproduces ions and have supply air flow over those tubes to saturate ions into wherever that supplyair is delivered to. Significant energy reduction will be achieved if a combined MERV 13 filter and BPImatches the performance of a HEPA filter. Additionally, the proposed project outcome includesreducing water consumption when growing mushrooms in a controlled indoor environment usingthe BPI technology, which meets both the Food-Energy-Water Systems and Small Farmer TechSolutions areas of the F3 Collaborative R&D Challenge Program.",grapes.jpg
Development of Artificial Intelligence Controlled Fuel Cell based Hybrid Power System in Agricultural applications ,"Woonki Na, Po Ya Abel Chuang","California�s economy relies heavily on agriculture as it generates at least $100 billion annually inrelated economic activity. To support this industry, a significant amount of water and energy arerequired. With the increasing energy cost and the scarcity of water caused by the drought, asustainable solution is in critical need to resolve both water and energy issues for agricultural
applications. We propose the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) controlled fuel cell basedhybrid power system for agricultural applications, such as the irrigation system and etc. The primarylong-term goal of this proposal is to provide solutions for agriculture applications to conserve waterand energy, which, in turn, will reduce emissions, improve air quality, and enhance the economicsituation in California.Firstly, one of the main tasks in the project is to develop Artificial Intelligence-based advancedcontroller for the power electronics interfaces in renewable/alternative energy systems to mitigatethe nonlinearities and chattering issues for the backup power system in agricultural applications.Secondly, in order to apply the proposed advanced controller to complex dynamic energy systems,the effective dynamic energy system models will be developed including the fuel cell system. Theproposed complex dynamic energy system will be validated using various computer simulation toolsbased on the Hardware-In-the Loop System using Digital Signal Processor.Based upon completion of the project, an efficient and reliable energy flow control algorithmbased on AI would be delivered using the developed dynamic models with the proposed system.",viticulture_robot.png
"Using biochar co-compost to foster a climate smart, circular agriculture economy","Rebecca Ryals, Xuan Zhang, Catherine Keske","California plans to significantly expand its composting capacity by 2025 to meet SB 1383, its short-lived climate pollutant reduction law. Though composting is a powerful climate change mitigation strategy, it canemit air pollution and odor that can harm the physical and mental health of community members. In a recent field trial, we showed that adding biochar to compost (i.e. biochar co-composting) significantly reducesgreenhouse gas emissions. While evidence is limited, some studies suggest that this practice can also reduce air pollutant emissions. We propose a commercial-scale experiment to investigate the potential of biochar tominimize air pollution from composting of dairy manure and agricultural green wastes. As California ramps up its efforts to divert organic resources from landfills, we seek to test a novel strategy that could maximizethe climate benefit of composting while minimizing the risk it poses to the health of rural, Disadvantaged Communities. We seek F3 Match Funds to augment our current research, which is focused on climate benefits ofbiochar co-composting, in two critical ways:1. We will quantify the impact of biochar co-composting on emissions of air pollutants, including ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).2. Conduct an economic assessment of biochar co-compost production in the San Joaquin Valley.",water_treatment.jpg
Development of an Interactive Information System (IIS) to Improve Agricultural Farm Management Efficiency,"Dilruba Yeasmin, Giulia Marino","An integrated and interactive platform that contains multiple information about an agriculturalfarm, its available resources, operations, and management practices can help farm managers, farmowners, farm advisors and other researchers to make informed and timely management decisions.Many agencies and industries maintain interactive information system (IIS) and database. More
slowly, also the agriculture industry is adopting IIS to implement more successful and cost effectivefarm management.Main objective of the proposed project is to utilize Geographic Information System and itsdatabase management platform combined with ArcGIS online (ESRI�s cloud-based platform) todevelop a pilot IIS for agricultural farm management. Some other available software will also beexplored and tested to improve this system. The ISS will be developed for the experimental farms ofFresno State University campus (1000 acres) and Kearney Agricultural Research and ExtensionCenter (330 acres).These two experimental farms show many differences in their farming operation, managementstyle, and offer a wide range of different crops. This variability will ensure that the pilot study can beadapted in the future to be utilized by different research Ag farms or private Ag farms. This pilot testwill also provide information on possible challenges, areas of improvements in the technological sideand for data availability and accessibility. Utilizing this pilot study outcome, larger grant funding canbe acquired from USDA NIFA or USDA AFRI to develop a generic, customizable and easy to adoptfarm management IIS that can be available for free or at minimal cost.",grapes.jpg
