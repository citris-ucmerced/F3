Luca Brillante,Agrifood Technology Faculty,Assistant Professor,"I am a computational agronomist that specializes in precision and digital agriculture, development, and testing of new cultural practices, models, technologies and machines to improve the management, sustainability, and profitability of agricultural land. I am also interested in understanding the effects of environmental constraints on grapevine physiology to implement variable rate and site-specific (terroir) management approaches. Testing new viticulture practices and farming inputs to cope with contemporary issues like climate change and workforce availability is also important in my daily work. I have published 24 peer-reviewed research papers in leading scientific journals, one international patent, and over 50 papers and abstracts in national and international conferences. I serve as Editor for the journals Oeno One, Frontiers in Plant Science, Sustainability, Agronomy, and Plants. I also write regularly in trade journals in the USA and Italy and present research results in professional meetings. I was ranked #1 most promising scholars in precision agriculture in California by the League of Scholar, 2018.",Luca_Brillante.jpeg
Qin Fan,Agrifood Technology Faculty,Associate Professor,"Qin's research focuses on the linkage between human behavior and environmental system. Her previous and current research involves examining regional economic impacts of climate change by considering feedback from different markets and updating human behavioral changes. Based on economic theory, Qin develops hypotheses about how individuals make decisions in response to changes in climate, environmental services, urban amenities, and other related aspects in the environmental system. Qin uses empirical techniques and modeling works to link environmental services to human behaviors and public policies.",Qin_Fan.jpeg
